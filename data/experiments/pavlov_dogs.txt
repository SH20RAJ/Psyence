# Pavlov's Classical Conditioning

## Definition
Ivan Pavlov's groundbreaking experiments with dogs that demonstrated how neutral stimuli can become conditioned to elicit automatic responses through association learning.

## Key Concepts
- Unconditioned Stimulus (UCS): food naturally causing salivation
- Unconditioned Response (UCR): natural salivation to food
- Conditioned Stimulus (CS): bell sound paired with food
- Conditioned Response (CR): learned salivation to bell alone
- Acquisition, extinction, and spontaneous recovery phases

## Examples
- Dogs salivating to bell sound after food pairing
- Fear responses to dentist office after painful procedures
- Emotional reactions to songs associated with memories
- Brand preferences formed through positive associations
- Phobias developed through traumatic experiences

## Applications
- Behavior therapy and systematic desensitization
- Advertising and brand association strategies
- Educational conditioning and learning environments
- Treatment of phobias and anxiety disorders
- Understanding addiction and craving triggers

## Related Theories / Biases
- Availability heuristic (memorable associations)
- Confirmation bias (seeking confirming associations)
- Anchoring bias (first associations strongest)
- Emotional conditioning and implicit learning
