## Definition
The tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information encountered (the "anchor") when making decisions or judgments.

## Key Concepts

- Adjustment from anchor is typically insufficient
- Occurs even with irrelevant or random anchors
- Affects numerical estimates, negotiations, and valuations

## Examples
